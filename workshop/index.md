## Overview
By its definition, the term of “first-principles” represents a philosophy that the prediction is to be based on a basic, fundamental proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. This implies that the computational formulations are based on the most fundamental theory of quantum mechanics - Schrödinger equation or density functional theory (DFT) and the inputs to the calculations must be based on well-defined physical constants – the nuclear and electronic charges. In another words, once the atomic species of an assigned material are known, the theory should predict the energy of all possible crystalline structures, without invoking any phenomenological fitting parameters.

However, to perform DFT calculations in reality, the user still needs to have extensive experiences on a variety of parameter choices and a lot of human handling on numerical or system exceptions. In the last decade, we have been working on solving the problem by integrating our experiences accumulated on high-throughout DFT calculations into a software package named as DFTTK (DFT based toolkits) and opened to the community.

This workshop will give a detailed introduction to computational software for high-throughput first-principles calculations  – DFTTK. It will feature hands-on demonstrations in an interactive cloud environment and practical exercises that will enable attendees to perform DFT calculations once a structure is given.
 
### [dfttk](https://www.dfttk.org/en/master/)
DFTTK is a free and open-source Python library for calculating all kinds of thermodynamic properties at finite temperature and pressure by first-principles approach based on density functional theory, including lattice vibration, thermal electron excitation, Seebeck coefficient, Lorenz number, effective charge carrier concentration etc.

The goal of DFTTK is to make high-throughput first-principles calculations as simple as possible. The density functional theory (DFT) based software VASP is employed to perform first-principles calculations. In addition thermodynamic properties via the quasiharmonic approach, we proposed that any property, as long as it is dependent on the volume or stain, can be predicted using a quasi-static approach implemented by our group according to (i) the predicted property-volume/strain relationship from first-principles calculations directly and (ii) the volume/strain-temperature relationship of materials from the quasiharmonic approach.
