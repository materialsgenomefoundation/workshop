Krajewski (Pennsylvania State University) Richard Otis (Materials Genome Foundation) Zi-Kui Liu (Pennsylvania State University) Where: Virtual (Zoom) When: 12 pm - 1:30 pm EST (6 - 7:30 pm CET / 9 - 10:30 am PST) on March 2, 2023 Registration deadline: February 28, 2023 Overview \u00b6 This workshop will provide an introduction to the pySIPFENN tool for structure-informed prediction of formation energy. It will include short introductory lectures followed by hands-on demonstrations in an interactive cloud environment. In the end, all attendees will be able to (1) install the software on their machine, (2) run all default neural network models on a set of structure files (e.g., POSCAR), and (3) incorporate pySIPFENN into their research as a surrogate for density-functional theory (DFT) calculation. Recently Machine Learning (ML) is becoming an increasingly important tool for material discovery, thanks to its ability to predict results of time and cost-intensive calculations like first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), allowing researchers to guide them efficiently. The default pySIPFENN models shipped with the software and included in this workshop are trained on large (hundreds of thousands) open DFT datasets using structure-informed features to predict the formation energy of an arbitrary atomic configuration. Workshop attendees will gain the ability to perform formation energy predictions on large sets of atomic structures with high accuracy and low computational cost. After the workshop, they will be able to independently install pySIPFENN, fetch models from repositories, and run them on both personal machines and high-performance computers (HPC), as needed. Advanced users will also be able to set up pySIPFENN for parallel computation and utilize customized models. All attendees will also gain helpful insight into manipulating crystal structures using the pymatgen and Spglib libraries. Adam M. Krajewski is the lead developer of pySIPFENN and a 4th year PhD student working with Prof. Zi-Kui Liu at The Pennsylvania State University. Adam's research focuses on a wide variety of databases and software tools for computational thermodynamics. Prof. Liu has over 20 years of experience in the prediction of fundamental thermodynamic properties such as formation enthalpy, and for the last four years, works with Adam on machine learning (ML) surrogates to guide experiments and more expensive ab-initio methods.

We, too, are a shared community resource \u2014 a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation. These are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse. Inclusivity \u00b6 We want to be unequivocal in recognizing that the scientific community has serious issues with representation, with people being excluded or marginalized on the basis of sex, race, and other personal characteristics. There is absolutely no place for sexism, racism, or any other kind of discrimination or prejudice in modern science, and we want to take an active role to ensure our community is a fair, equitable, and welcoming place. Our community is stronger and more effective when it recognizes all voices equally and treats everyone with respect. There will be zero tolerance for harassment and any behavior that is discriminatory on the basis of age, disability, gender, relationship status, maternity, race, ethnicity, religion, sex or sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics. If any such behavior is noticed, members of the workshop are encouraged to let us know so that appropriate action can be taken. Improve the Discussion \u00b6 Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your response adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later. The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said. Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree \u00b6 You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That\u2019s fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid: Name-calling. Ad hominem attacks. Responding to a post\u2019s tone instead of its actual content. Knee-jerk contradiction. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation. Your Participation Counts \u00b6 The conversations we have here set the tone for everyone. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this workshop an interesting place to be \u2014 and avoiding those that do not. Let\u2019s try to leave our park better than we found it. If You See a Problem, Report It \u00b6 Instructors have special authority; they are responsible for this workshop. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police. When you see bad behavior, don\u2019t reply. It encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone\u2019s time. Just report it. In order to maintain our community, instructors reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Instructors do not preview new attendee material in any way; the instructors and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community. Always Be Civil \u00b6 Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness: Be civil . Don\u2019t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Keep it clean . Don\u2019t post anything obscene or sexually explicit. Respect each other . Don\u2019t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information. Respect our workshop . Don\u2019t post spam or otherwise vandalize the Slack. These are not concrete terms with precise definitions \u2014 avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you\u2019re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#code-of-conduct","text":"","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#this-is-a-civilized-place-for-public-discussion","text":"Please treat this workshop with the same respect you would a public park.
