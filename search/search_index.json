This implies that the computational formulations are based on the most fundamental theory of quantum mechanics - Schr\u00f6dinger equation or density functional theory (DFT) and the inputs to the calculations must be based on well-defined physical constants \u2013 the nuclear and electronic charges. In another words, once the atomic species of an assigned material are known, the theory should predict the energy of all possible crystalline structures, without invoking any phenomenological fitting parameters. However, to perform DFT calculations in reality, the user still needs to have extensive experiences on a variety of parameter choices and a lot of human handling on numerical or system exceptions. In the last decade, we have been working on solving the problem by integrating our experiences accumulated on high-throughout DFT calculations into a software package named as DFTTK (DFT based toolkits) and opened to the community. This workshop will give a detailed introduction to computational software for high-throughput first-principles calculations \u2013 DFTTK. It will feature hands-on demonstrations in an interactive cloud environment and practical exercises that will enable attendees to perform DFT calculations once a structure is given. dfttk \u00b6 DFTTK is a free and open-source Python library for calculating all kinds of thermodynamic properties at finite temperature and pressure by first-principles approach based on density functional theory, including lattice vibration, thermal electron excitation, Seebeck coefficient, Lorenz number, effective charge carrier concentration etc. The goal of DFTTK is to make high-throughput first-principles calculations as simple as possible. The density functional theory (DFT) based software VASP is employed to perform first-principles calculations. In addition thermodynamic properties via the quasiharmonic approach, we proposed that any property, as long as it is dependent on the volume or stain, can be predicted using a quasi-static approach implemented by our group according to (i) the predicted property-volume/strain relationship from first-principles calculations directly and (ii) the volume/strain-temperature relationship of materials from the quasiharmonic approach. How to register \u00b6 Interested graduate students, postdoctoral or early-career researchers, and other enthusiasts are encouraged to register prior to the deadline on December 12, 2022 . Please be sure to use a valid e-mail address, as this is how the organizers will communicate with you regarding workshop logistics. Registration will open shortly.

We, too, are a shared community resource \u2014 a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation. These are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse. Inclusivity \u00b6 We want to be unequivocal in recognizing that the scientific community has serious issues with representation, with people being excluded or marginalized on the basis of sex, race, and other personal characteristics. There is absolutely no place for sexism, racism, or any other kind of discrimination or prejudice in modern science, and we want to take an active role to ensure our community is a fair, equitable, and welcoming place. Our community is stronger and more effective when it recognizes all voices equally and treats everyone with respect. There will be zero tolerance for harassment and any behavior that is discriminatory on the basis of age, disability, gender, relationship status, maternity, race, ethnicity, religion, sex or sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics. If any such behavior is noticed, members of the workshop are encouraged to let us know so that appropriate action can be taken. Improve the Discussion \u00b6 Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your response adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later. The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said. Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree \u00b6 You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That\u2019s fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid: Name-calling. Ad hominem attacks. Responding to a post\u2019s tone instead of its actual content. Knee-jerk contradiction. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation. Your Participation Counts \u00b6 The conversations we have here set the tone for everyone. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this workshop an interesting place to be \u2014 and avoiding those that do not. Let\u2019s try to leave our park better than we found it. If You See a Problem, Report It \u00b6 Instructors have special authority; they are responsible for this workshop. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police. When you see bad behavior, don\u2019t reply. It encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone\u2019s time. Just report it. In order to maintain our community, instructors reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Instructors do not preview new attendee material in any way; the instructors and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community. Always Be Civil \u00b6 Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness: Be civil . Don\u2019t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Keep it clean . Don\u2019t post anything obscene or sexually explicit. Respect each other . Don\u2019t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information. Respect our workshop . Don\u2019t post spam or otherwise vandalize the Slack. These are not concrete terms with precise definitions \u2014 avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you\u2019re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#code-of-conduct","text":"","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#this-is-a-civilized-place-for-public-discussion","text":"Please treat this workshop with the same respect you would a public park.
