While originally based on experimental measurements and extrapolation, the CALPHAD approach has been extended to also include results of atomistic simulation for phases and states which are not experimentally accessible. With the introduction of modern workflow management tools in the atomistic community, it is now possible to use atomistic simulations to facilitate rapid CALPHAD database development. More recently, methods and user tools have been developed that enable automated, reproducible CALPHAD parameter evaluation and uncertainty quantification. This workshop will give a detailed introduction to computational thermodynamic software based on the CALPHAD method \u2013 pycalphad and ESPEI - as well as an introduction to machine learning methods in computational materials science using the ASCENDS software. It will feature hands-on demonstrations in an interactive cloud environment and practical exercises that will enable attendees to perform machine learning calculations, develop CALPHAD databases with quantified uncertainty, and to propagate uncertainty to any thermodynamic calculation. ASCENDS \u00b6 The Advanced data SCiEnce toolkit for Non-Data scientists (ASCENDS) is an open-source toolkit to assist scientists/engineers who want to apply modern data analytics to their own tabular data without any programming from their local machines. It provides a streamlined, intuitive interface to analyze correlation, train machine learning models, and make predictions from surrogate digital twins within minutes. pycalphad \u00b6 pycalphad is a free and open-source Python library for calculating phase diagrams, designing thermodynamic models, and investigating phase equilibria within the CALPHAD method. It provides routines for reading thermodynamic databases and solving the multi-component, multi-phase Gibbs energy minimization problem. All Gibbs energy and property models in pycalphad are described symbolically allowing the models to be customized or overridden by users at runtime without changing any of the pycalphad source code. Calculation results from pycalphad are returned as multidimensional xarray datasets that make it easy to incorporate pycalphad into any tool or workflow. ESPEI \u00b6 The Extensible Self-optimizing Phase Equilibria Infrastructure (ESPEI) package is a tool for thermodynamic database development and uncertainty quantification within the CALPHAD method. It uses pycalphad for the forward calculation of thermodynamic properties to solve the inverse of parameter evaluation problem. ESPEI uses a two step method to first parameterize thermodynamic models and then optimize and determine the uncertainty of the parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). How to register \u00b6 Interested graduate students, postdoctoral or early-career researchers, and other enthusiasts are encouraged to register prior to the deadline on July 12, 2022 .

We, too, are a shared community resource \u2014 a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation. These are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse. Inclusivity \u00b6 We want to be unequivocal in recognizing that the scientific community has serious issues with representation, with people being excluded or marginalized on the basis of sex, race, and other personal characteristics. There is absolutely no place for sexism, racism, or any other kind of discrimination or prejudice in modern science, and we want to take an active role to ensure our community is a fair, equitable, and welcoming place. Our community is stronger and more effective when it recognizes all voices equally and treats everyone with respect. There will be zero tolerance for harassment and any behavior that is discriminatory on the basis of age, disability, gender, relationship status, maternity, race, ethnicity, religion, sex or sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics. If any such behavior is noticed, members of the workshop are encouraged to let us know so that appropriate action can be taken. Improve the Discussion \u00b6 Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your response adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later. The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said. Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree \u00b6 You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That\u2019s fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid: Name-calling. Ad hominem attacks. Responding to a post\u2019s tone instead of its actual content. Knee-jerk contradiction. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation. Your Participation Counts \u00b6 The conversations we have here set the tone for everyone. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this workshop an interesting place to be \u2014 and avoiding those that do not. Let\u2019s try to leave our park better than we found it. If You See a Problem, Report It \u00b6 Instructors have special authority; they are responsible for this workshop. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police. When you see bad behavior, don\u2019t reply. It encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone\u2019s time. Just report it. In order to maintain our community, instructors reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Instructors do not preview new attendee material in any way; the instructors and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community. Always Be Civil \u00b6 Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness: Be civil . Don\u2019t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Keep it clean . Don\u2019t post anything obscene or sexually explicit. Respect each other . Don\u2019t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information. Respect our workshop . Don\u2019t post spam or otherwise vandalize the Slack. These are not concrete terms with precise definitions \u2014 avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you\u2019re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#code-of-conduct","text":"","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#this-is-a-civilized-place-for-public-discussion","text":"Please treat this workshop with the same respect you would a public park.
